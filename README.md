# 📈 [GitHub Stats Visualization](https://github.com/R055A/GitStats) 🔭

Generate daily updated visualizations of user and repository statistics from the GitHub [GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) and [REST](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) APIs using GitHub [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets). Customizable visualizations support dark and light mode and can adapt to device sizes.

> A modification of [`jstrieb/github-stats`](https://github.com/jstrieb/github-stats) visualizations with new and improved statistics and more options!

# :rocket: Instructions

<details>
<summary>Click drop-down to view step-by-step instructions for generating your own GitHub statistics visualizations
</summary>

### Copy Repository

1. Click either link to start generating your own GitHub statistic visualizations: 
   1. [Generate your own copy of this repository without the commit history](https://github.com/R055A/GitStats/generate)
      * *Note: the first GitHub Actions workflow initiated at creation of the copied repository is expected to fail*
   2. [Fork a copy of this repository with the commit history configured to sync changes](https://github.com/R055A/GitStats/fork)
      * *Note: this copies all branches including the `action_branch` with statistics, but this can be overwritten*

### Generate a New Personal Access Token

2. Generate a personal access token by following these steps:
   1. If you are logged in, click this link to: [generate a new "classic" token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
      * *Otherwise, to learn how to generate a personal access token: [read these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)*
   2. Ensure it is a "classic" token being generated and not a "fine-grained" token
   2. Name the token
   3. Select your preferred '***Expiration***' date
   4. Select `repo` for '<u>**Full control of private repositories**</u>'
   5. Select `read:user` to '<u>**Read only ALL user profile data**</u>'
   6. Click the '***Generate token***' button
   7. Copy the generated token - there is only one opportunity provided for this

### Create ACCESS_TOKEN Secret

3. Create a repository secret for the personal access token by following these steps:
   1. If this is your copy of the repository, click this link to: [create a new secret](../../settings/secrets/actions/new)
      * *Otherwise, go to repository **Settings**, click the **Secrets** option, then click **New repository secret***
   2. Name the new secret: `ACCESS_TOKEN`
   3. Enter the generated **[personal access token](#generate-a-new-personal-access-token)** as the '*Value*'

### Run GitHub Actions Workflow

4. Manually generate GitHub statistics visualizations:
   1. This can be done using any of the following two GitHub Actions workflows:
      1. For the **first time**, or to **reset stored statistics** (although this is done with every push to the main):
         * Click the link to: [go to the **Generate Git Stats Images** GitHub Actions workflow](../../actions/workflows/non_auto_generate_stat_images.yml)
         > *This is required if the `actions_branch` branch is not created, as it is created when run*
      2. Otherwise, for **updating** generated statistics visualizations (although this is automatically done daily):
         * Click the link to: [go to the **Auto Update Stats Images** GitHub Actions workflow](../../actions/workflows/auto_update_stat_images.yml)
         > *This requires the `actions_branch` branch to first be created with generated statistics visualizations*
   2. With the GitHub Actions page open, click the '***Run workflow***' dropdown menu button
   3. Select `Branch: main` from the '***Use workflow from***' dropdown list
   4. Click the '***Run workflow***' button
       * _Note: this could take some time_

### View Generated Statistics

5. Following the successful completion of a workflow, generated statistics visualizations can be viewed:
   1. In the `generated_images` directory in the `actions_branch` branch with the following image links:
      1. [Language statistics](../../blob/actions_branch/generated_images/languages.svg)
      2. [Overview statistics](../../blob/actions_branch/generated_images/overview.svg)

### Display Generated Statistics

6. To display the generated statistics, static URLs can be used for images that are updated daily:
   1. For generated language statistics visualizations (replacing `<username>` with your GitHub username):
   ```md
   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/GitStats/actions_branch/generated_images/languages.svg)
   ```
   2. For generated overview statistic visualizations (replacing `<username>` with your GitHub username):
   ```md
   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/GitStats/actions_branch/generated_images/overview.svg)
   ```
